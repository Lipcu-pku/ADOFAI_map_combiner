# ADOFAI_map_combiner
a program to combine adofai charts together

known bug:

1. if the music of a map is in ".mp3" format, when transformed to ".ogg", offset changes
2. sometimes the camera or something goes wrong
3. **removed all decorations** because it's hard to tell whether the decoration is hidden at the end of the map
